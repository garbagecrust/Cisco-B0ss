Make the router your bitch. Requires AutoHotKey

Instructions: 

1. Router reset script
  connect via telnet or console
  press Ctrl + Alt + 1
  Please for the love of %DEITY% keep the Putty of CMD window selected
  When done, the router will reboot. Usually takes around 30-40 seconds

2. Basic setup script
  connect via console
  Press Ctrl + Alt + 2
  wait for around three seconds

3. Subnetting
  simply press the digits consisting of the network prefix length in order on the numpad
  for prefixes with duplicate numbers, press the first one on the numpad and the second on the keyboard
  note that this does break the numpad for normal operations, and you should really kill the script when you don't need it running.
